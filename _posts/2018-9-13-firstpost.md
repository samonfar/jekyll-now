## Regression Analysis

Regression analysis is a technique used to find trends in data. For example, if I want to find out the relationship between how much I eat and changes in my weight, I could use regression analysis. I can collect the data (i.e. my weight and how much food I consume) over a few months and plot the data. The graph would have two axes, one with my weight data and the other with the amount of food I consumed. Regressoin analysis could be used to get an equation for this graph that can then be used to make predictions about my weight if I continue to consume the same amount of food.
